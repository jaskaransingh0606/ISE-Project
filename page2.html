      <p>My primary research interests are in Information security and network security. However I am also interested in other recent technologies. I completed my BE degree in Computer science and Engineering from NIE, and joined as a faculty in the computer science department in the year 1990. I completed my MTech in Software Engineering in the year 2000 with II rank (VTU). I completed my PhD in the field of information security in the year 2019. I have written a study material on software engineering for MSCIT (KSOU). I am involved in various activities in the department as well as college level. I am a member of BoE and also a faculty selection committee member in other Engineering colleges. Study material on Computer network is available in the Google classroom</p>
